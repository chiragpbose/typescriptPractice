Typescript is created run on top of js to address shortcomings of js
Typescript = javascript + typechecking

.ts files => .js files : this is called transpilation 

rootDir: change path if required

outDir: tells where the .js file is located---> change to ".dist"

noImplicitReturns, noUnusedLocal, noUnusedParameters
noEmitOnError: uncomment this to ensure that the transpilation wont happen in case of any error

sourceMap--- needs more deepdive

tuple: we can specify that it'll contain 2 elements, each a different type.typescript does not complain heere if we push a 3rd variable of an unspecified type!!
